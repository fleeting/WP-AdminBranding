== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work on WordPress version x.x? =

Honestly, I have no clue. I have tested it on version 2.7+ and 2.8. I don't have installs of anything before 2.7 so it could work before that. I also don't plan to test or make it work on older versions if it doesn't. For security alone you should always be using the latest version.

= I have another question! =

Good, you can either email me at james.fleeting[at]gmail.com or post in the wordpress forums. I'm always browsing around.
